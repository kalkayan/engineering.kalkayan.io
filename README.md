# engineering.kalkayan.io

Since, early 2021 the website I write on was hosted at https://engineering.kalkayan.io. The shift to a new subdomain https://engineeringwith.kalkayan.io in 2022 had caused breaking of many links in the blogs/README.md of people who has reference the articles. 

This repository is for restoring those broken links. Why this uncultured way of redirecting and not redirects through DNS manager? Please Don't ask such questions.
