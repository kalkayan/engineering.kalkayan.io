The Elekto Project develops Elekto, simple software for secure online elections. Elekto was created as part of an LFX internship for the Kubernetes project under the guidance of [Josh Berkus](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/681bd33c-52c8-450e-97d6-cf95d3493ac6), [Marky Jackson](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/cbceda22-d448-4121-adc1-c4f793291bea), [Sergey Kanzhelev](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/mentor/20ddefe1-872a-4077-ba0c-f85ebdfb7fd5), and is now a CNCF infrastructure project.
