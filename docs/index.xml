      <description>There is something fascinating about customizing your operating system through dotfiles, and there are tons of articles on what you can do with these dotfiles. These simple invisible files may seem pointless for a novice, but they become a swiss army knife if properly configured.
This repository is the collection of configurations that I learned over time and still use for my daily work. I primarily use a 13&#39; Macbook pro (named hades) and Ubuntu on AWS/GCP; therefore, this repository mainly applies to macOS and debians, but Improvements or contributions for other platforms are more than welcome.</description>
