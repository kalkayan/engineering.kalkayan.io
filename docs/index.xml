      <description>In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll create a script (lets call it as setup) in $HOME directory to automate all the installations and other setup. Lets make a list of bins (available on brew) and casks that we want to install. In the setup file add two array - bins and casks.
#!/bin/bash  # Brew casks and binaries that you need bins = ( &amp;#34;nvm&amp;#34; &amp;#34;php@7.4&amp;#34; &amp;#34;composer&amp;#34; # more valid brew formula here ) casks=( &amp;#34;slack&amp;#34; &amp;#34;postman&amp;#34; # add brew casks that you need  ) Compilers and Interpreters The first thing in the setup for any type of software development should be getting the language support - installating the compiler, interpreters etc.</description>

      <description>Something is fascinating about customizing your operating system through dotfiles, and there are tons of articles out there on what you can do with these dotfiles. These simple invisible files may seem pointless for a novice, but they become a swiss army knife if properly configured.
In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss configuring these files and the best way to manage them for multiple devices.
 This article will discuss a way to setup a new machine in under a minute and a seamless way to switch between two different machines using the single repository.</description>
