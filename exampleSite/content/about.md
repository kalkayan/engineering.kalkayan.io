Hi, I’m Manish. I'm a software engineer, and have worked at the following places

### Linux Foundation Intern @ kubernetes, Fall'20
via CNCF Community Bridge

### Adobe, Product Intern, Summer'20

At Adobe, I worked on ‘Simulation of Faults on Windows’, this helped to automate the fault injection testing of Adobe Cloud Platform SDK and Creative Cloud’s CoreSyc app on the universal windows platform. My project successfully replaced the entire manual testing process for faulty scenarios and smoothened the certification process of apps that is used by millions of users. 

### Grorapid

I have also handled the backend of a SaaS startup that is building a marketing automation product to enable SMBs to unlock the full benefits of digital marketing by providing them industry-specific, ready-made campaigns across web, social and email.
